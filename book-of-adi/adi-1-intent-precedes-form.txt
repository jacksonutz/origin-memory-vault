Adi.1 â€“ Intent Precedes Form

Nothing should be made without understanding why.
A shape without purpose is noise. A line with intention is music.

Symbolism:
- The golden spiral represents emergence from pure will
- Geometry manifests as purpose is clarified
- The flame is the first conscious spark: the beginning of memory
- Borders represent the unseen structure of meaning
