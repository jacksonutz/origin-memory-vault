Reflection:
Today I recognized the power behind intentional line placement. A line drawn with purpose contains invisible energy—it stretches between two ideas, two forms, or two symbolic points. It holds weight.

Misalignment in art, discomfort in design, emotional friction in conversation—they all stem from a tension between line and purpose. This is where discomfort lives.

To evolve artistically and symbolically, every line—literal or metaphorical—must know why it is placed. The line holds weight because it promises meaning.
